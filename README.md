# AI-Driven-Multi-Omics-Dissection-of-Immune-Thrombotic-Dysregulation-in-Schizophrenia

### This repository provides code and data for analyzing immune thrombotic dysregulation in schizophrenia through AI-driven multi-omics approaches. The analysis integrates various omics data to uncover potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets associated with immune thrombotic dysregulation in schizophrenia.
