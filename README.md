# AI-Driven-Multi-Omics-Dissection-of-Immune-Thrombotic-Dysregulation-in-Schizophrenia

### This repository provides code and data for analyzing immune thrombotic dysregulation in schizophrenia through AI-driven multi-omics approaches. The analysis integrates various omics data to uncover potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets associated with immune thrombotic dysregulation in schizophrenia.

## Prerequisites

### To run the code in this repository, ensure you have the following software installed:

Python 3.8 or higher

R 4.0 or higher

Necessary Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, shap, etc.

Necessary R packages: ggplot2, dplyr, etc.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/totnii52/AI-Driven-Multi-Omics-Dissection-of-Immune-Thrombotic-Dysregulation-in-Schizophrenia.git

cd AI-Driven-Multi-Omics-Dissection-of-Immune-Thrombotic-Dysregulation-in-Schizophrenia

### 2. Install Python dependencies:

It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv env

source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'env\Scripts\activate'

pip install -r requirements.txt

If requirements.txt is not provided, manually install the necessary packages:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn shap

### 3. Install R packages:

Open R and install the required packages:

install.packages("ggplot2")

install.packages("dplyr") # Add other necessary packages as needed

## Usage
### Data Preparation
Place your raw data files in the appropriate directories. 
Ensure that train_data.csv and test_data.csv are correctly formatted and located in the repository's root directory.

### Running the Notebooks

#### 1.single_multi_omics.ipynb: This notebook integrates single and multi-omics data.

jupyter notebook single_multi_omics.ipynb # Follow the procedures to merge and analyze omics datasets.

#### 2.shap.ipynb: This notebook performs SHAP analysis to interpret model predictions.

jupyter notebook shap.ipynb # Follow the steps to load the trained model and generate SHAP values.

#### 3. 3metric.ipynb: This notebook calculates key metrics for the analysis.

jupyter notebook 3metric.ipynb # Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess data and compute metrics.

### Running the R Script
#### 1. 富集.R: This R script performs enrichment analysis.

source("富集.R") # Ensure that the necessary data files are in the working directory.

## Results

### After running the notebooks and scripts, you will obtain:

Processed data files: all_nona_scale_label.csv, pro_nona_scale_label.csv, etc.

Model outcome files: model_outcome_all.csv, model_outcome_meta.csv, etc.

Visualizations and interpretations as generated by the notebooks.
